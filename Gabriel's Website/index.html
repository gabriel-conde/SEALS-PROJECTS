        <div class="paragraphs">
        <p>I chose a guitar because it allows me to display my creativity. 
            Guitar truly has made me a more creative person in other aspects of life outside of music. 
            I really enjoy music whether it be rock or classical. It is one of my passions. 
            I have played guitar for multiple years and I like to play guitar with my friends to make music.
            I have overcome many challenges when learning guitar whether it be having blisters on my fingers or breaking a string. 
            I use guitar to express myself and my feelings. 
            Guitar has allowed me to create friendships and meet new people who share my same love for music.
            I have continued to use guitar to relax when I am feeling overwhelmed or have a lack of energy.
            Despite things that have been going on during these difficult times, guitar has been an escape for me.</p>

        <div class="paragraphs">
            <p>Today I have learned how to be come more self aware.
               Being self aware allows me to live out the creed; 
               "I will strive to know myself better and seek self improvement".
               Being honest with myself can better my understanding of how to make
               better plans. I have maed a plan for every challenge and class but 
               I need to improve on executing it through managing my time. 
               I need to cut out spending time on my phone and playing viedeogames to
                get ahead and complete tasks before they are due. I also learned to be more specific and not be 
               so broad. I should use specific details like numbers and times to legitimize
               my statements. I shouldn't allow people to make assumptions about what I say
               so I should be clear so they undestand me. In the beginning of this program
               I have seen my strengths and weaknesses. If I do my research and ask for help 
               I can get code done easily and faster. I enjoy engaging with my other pups to
               complete our challenges just as much as i enjoy helping them. I am glad to grow
               as leaders with Adelmo, Jonathan, Manuel, Kevin, Carlos, Mustafa, Mohammad, David, and Bryan.
