          <h1 class="headers">Why Join Junior SCLA?</h1>
        <p>Joining the Junior Sumer Coding Leadership Academy can allow you to learn new skills in tech and how to 
        one day arrive at large tech orginzations and companies. You will learn Leadership skills, CS skills, Design Thinking
        Skills, and Entrepreneural/ Project Management Skills. Learning how to design and code with others 
        can allow you not to only grow as youth but as leaders. These skills are essential when solving the problems in 
        your community.</p>
        <p>
        TXT works with students to meet the challenges of adulthood to achieve their full potentials. In Junior SCLA youth like you discover their strengths and weaknesses. The program encourages
        you to work in groups and engage in good faith arguments to encourage exponential personal growth. TXT programs 
        foster significant improvements in self-advocacy, community responsibility, control of emotions, and much more.
        </p>
        <p>
        A full-stack developer is comfortable working with all the technologies required to develop an idea into a 
        finished product. During this program students learn to code both the front and back ends of their web or 
        mobile applications. TXT believes that by teaching you how to study coding languages, you can make a better 
        decision of becoming a Computer Science major.
        </p>
        <p>
        TXT teaches students to use the Business Model Canvas where they learn to develop a value proposition, identify 
        their target market, collect and analyze data, and more. The program also teaches students to plan strategically
        and to develop professional relationships and partnerships.

        <p>"I joined TXT through the Summer Coding Leadership Acedemy and it honestly changed my life.
        I have learned skills such as how to speak up and solve problems in my own community of Los Angeles.
        Joining the program allowed me to realize my own potential when it came to leadership. Here at TXT
        we say that "Nothing is hard, just alot of work". This is so true especially when it comes to coding, design, 
        and any obstacles you encounter in life. Before joining TXT, I was a shy and reserved kid. TXT has given
        me the confidence in myself and the confidence to pursue my own dreams."</p>

        <p id="HTML-paragraph">HTML stands for "Hypertext Markup Language". It is the standard markup language for documents designed
           to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets
           (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

        <img id="CSS"src="./assets/CSS Logo.png">
        <p id="CSS-paragraph">CSS stands for “Cascading Style Sheets”. Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for
           describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. This language 
           contains coding elements and is composed of these “cascading style 
           sheets” which are called CSS files.

        <p id="JS-paragraph">JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows
           you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web 
           pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.
